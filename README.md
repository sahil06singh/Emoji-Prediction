In this project, the model is predicting emoji's according to a given sentence using Deep Learning Models. I have used LSTM as well as Stacked LSTM to predict the emoji and compared theie accuracy.


# Algorithm's Used
-LSTM
-RNN




# Additional Files
I have used GLOVE6B50D embeddings to create the embedding vector of the words.
